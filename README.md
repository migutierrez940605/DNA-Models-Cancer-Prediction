# DNA-Models-Cancer-Prediction
Report I

This report presents the methodological design of the research. Characterization of three methods of extraction of linear characteristics is carried out and the main problems presented by DNA microarray data are commented on. We propose a methodology that consists of three stages to obtain a classification model that predicts different oncological diseases. Finally, a discussion of the results is made by said methodology.

Report II

In this report a characterization of the random algorithms, particularly the matrix decomposition CUR is performed. We propose two methodologies whose main idea is the decomposition of CUR to obtain a classification model. Finally, a discussion of the results is made by both methods.
Future Projects 
We will use the results of the measure values ("sensitivity", "specificity", and “accuracy”) of each model to create a dynamic visualization in Tableau to get insight easier.
